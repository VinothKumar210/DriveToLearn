Project Title

Interactive Learning Driving Game with AI-Generated Questions

Project Overview

This project is an educational and interactive web game where users can learn and test their knowledge in a fun and engaging way. The user inputs a paragraph or notes, and the system automatically generates multiple-choice questions based on that text using the Gemini AI API. The player then answers these questions by driving a car in a 4-lane road simulation, where each lane corresponds to an answer option.

The game combines learning, decision-making, and real-time gameplay. As the player answers questions correctly, the difficulty gradually increases by adding more traffic, obstacles, or time pressure.

How It Works

User Input:

The user types or pastes a paragraph or notes into an input box on the website.

Question Generation:

The backend sends the paragraph to the Gemini AI API.

The API generates multiple-choice questions with 4 options and identifies the correct answer.

Interactive Gameplay:

The game displays a 4-lane road on the screen.

Each lane represents one of the 4 answer options (A, B, C, D).

The player moves their car to the lane corresponding to what they think is the correct answer.

Answer Checking & Feedback:

Correct lane → the player scores points and moves to the next question.

Wrong lane → the player loses a life or points; the correct answer is shown.

Difficulty Progression:

As the player progresses, the game becomes harder:

Faster car movement

More traffic and obstacles

Reduced time per question

Game End & Results:

The game ends when all questions are answered or the player runs out of lives.

Final score and performance metrics are displayed.
